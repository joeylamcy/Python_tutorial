# Lab exercise (9 Jan 2019)

Please submit the following exercise:
1. List and Dictionaries

   Put your name and year of study in a **list**. Use the `print()` function to print `My name is ` followed by your name and a full stop `.`. On the next line, print `I am a year ` followed by your year of study, and ` student.`. 

   Sample output:
   ``` 
   My name is Joey. I am a year 1 student.
   ```
   Now put your name and year of study in a **dictionary**. Use the `print()` function to generate the same output.

2. Functions and Calculations

   Define a function for the following formula, which calculates the saturation vapor pressure of a temperature:

   It is given that the air temperature is now 18 degree Celsius and the dew point temperature is 13.5 degree Celsius, find the relative humidity (in %). Use the `print()` function to print `The relative humidity is ` followed by your answer and the percentage sign `%` and a full stop `.`. 

   Sample output:
   ``` 
   The relative humidity is 30.1%.
   ```
   Optional: Learn to use `format()` to limit the output of your answer to one decimal place.

You may submit your answers in .ipynb or .py format on Blackboard. Make sure you name your file in a meaningful way and don't leave any space(s) in the file name. (I don't want to receive something like "Untitled.ipynb", or "a.py")
