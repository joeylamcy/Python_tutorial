    "Objective: You want to tell the computer to do something. It can be as simple as adding two numbers, but also as complicated as plotting, making a video, doing an operation a million times, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a programming *language* like Python, you can *communicate* with the computer relatively easily (compared to using only 1 and 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why should you use a programming language, not a software? \n",
    "1. General Purpose: A programming language is more flexible while a software is designed to accomplish a specific task with ease. Ease of use and flexibility is always a tradeoff.\n",
    "1. Repeatibility: If we have to repeat a task many times (maybe with minor variations), then programming can be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Python?\n",
    "- High-level programming language: No compilation needed, well-developed Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to make coding and testing easier.\n",
    "- Open source and free: There's no license, and most libraries and IDEs are free and open to public.\n",
    "  - Popular: Also means you would find the answers to most problems/questions online :)\n",
    "  - Many libraries: Libraries help you accomplish tasks easier. \n",
    "- General Purpose: It can accomplish different kinds of task, and thus is used by people from different industries, e.g. backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, etc.\n",
    "- Beginner friendly: Syntax are easy to learn, and can be read like English."

    "If you just want to do some quick testing or very simple operations, you may just use **command-line mode**. On the other hand, **script mode** is for writing, saving and editing longer scripts that you have typed. However, as a good IDE, it is essential to have both so that users can easily test easily as they write.\n",

    "#### Mixed mode\n",
